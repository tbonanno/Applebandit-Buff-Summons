# Applebandit-Buff-Summons2
WoW Classic World Buff Summoning Addon

This addon is a fork of Applebandit Buff Summons: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/applebandit-buff-summons

### Original Description from CurseForge:

This addon provides a number of useful features to assist in summoning your guild to world buffs.

Open the addon by typing /summon
Features

Start an automatic summon message that repeats every 2 minutes
E.g. "Need a summon to Dire Maul? Type DMT for group invite/summon".

Different summon messages/codes depending on your location
If you have multiple warlocks spread around, each location will have their own code to make it easy to tell who needs to be summoned where.

People who need a summon appear in a list
Once someone types the code (e.g. DMT), they will be invited and appear in a list to be summoned.

Automatically request clickers if nobody is nearby
If there are less than 2 nearby players (who aren't AFK), the automatic message will change to "Need X clicker(s) for Dire Maul summons".

Other useful features

    You can enter buff times and it will put them in the summoning message, e.g. "next HOH at 7:20pm"
    When you start a summon, it will whisper the player and post in raid chat
    Warlocks can be auto-promoted to assist so they can easily invite
    Raid assists can click a button to remove/clean raid group so it doesn't get full
    Raid leaders can click a button to disband raid
    Whispering "inv" (or the summoning code) will automatically invite people

 

This addon is partly based on the excellent Consequence Summons by Zyrrael.
